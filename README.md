HW 1

## Description

This is the first bootcamp Challenge. I was tasked with "refactoring" the original HTML code to the Challenge's standards with using an agile project management approach. We were to consolidate the CSS selectors and properties to allow for a cleaner semantic structure. I also added alt attributes for better accessibility.

I learned to take this slow and steady. It's best practice to comment on your changes as this decreases your chance of STAYING lost. This is tedious work and a constant trial and error. What I love the most about this is that code doesn't lie and teamwork is everything.
